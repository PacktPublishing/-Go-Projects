# Go Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Go Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/go-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460103), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course introduces a range of programming projects with the Go language, demonstrating how to put the language to use for a variety of real world applications and services. These projects can range from command line tools, to distributed messaging services, web services and web applications with Go running on the server side. We want to demonstrate how versatile the language can be and how it can be put to use in a range of real world programming domains, whether thats for DevOps tools, cloud-based services, or RESTful web services. Interwoven with the projects should be demonstrations of best practices and design patterns, and techniques viewers can carry over to their own projects. Projects should also demonstrate the key features of Go in action, such as concurrency, and ideally start to explore the rich ecosystem of open source libraries and frameworks that are being continually developed for the language. A great overlying commentary which would give this video course depth is for the author to discuss and then model the projects based on its popular usages (for example how Docker and Soundcloud use the language). The driving force of what the author should demonstrate is what Go is powerful for, such as creating fast, real time applications and services that may leverage the use of concurrency.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
There is a plural audience for this course. Experienced programmers with a background in another language - this can be anything from Ruby to C or JavaScript - and want to be shown how to develop projects of their own. They are fast learners and are versed enough in general programming to pick up the techniques and logic needed to build the projects showcased in the course. The other segment of this audience is comprised of programmers who are currently hacking around in Go, know the fundamentals, but need a more structured way of understanding how to put this knowledge into practice.
### Technical Requirements
